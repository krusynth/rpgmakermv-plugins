/*:
 * Airship Events
 *
 * @plugindesc 1.0 Allows airships to interact with events.

 * @author Krusynth
 *
 * @help
 * By default, RPG Maker MV doesn't allow airships to interact with events.
 * This plugin removes that limitation, allowing airships to land in towns, etc.
 *
 * Note that you'll have to create special handling for dealing with
 * transfers (e.g. entering towns, etc.) for airships to use this as
 * expected.  The easiest way to achieve this is to add to your event
 * a Conditional Branch for Vehicle: Airship is driven and move the
 * transfer into the Else clause.
